	<FiveFactorDescription>The {0} (Big Five) was developed in the late 20th century based on the lexical hypothesis, which suggested that the fundamental traits of personality are encoded in language.\n\nFive factors have consistently emerged from analyses conducted on numerous data sets of descriptive trait terms from multiple languages, including English, Chinese, Russian, and German.\n\nTwin and adoption studies have revealed a substantial genetic component, and individuals' relative standings have also been shown to be fairly stable across the adult life span.<!--\n\nSource: Britannica--></FiveFactorDescription>
